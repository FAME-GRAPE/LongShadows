THIS DOFILE REPLICATES THE RESULTS FOR HAGEMEJER & TYROWICZ 
The authors received wonderful research assistance from P. Szewczyk 

The only file necessary to obtain a full set of results are in the folder data/sources
All other files are generated by the dofiles

There are two rounds of data preparation
* prep00 prepares the original data from the Karpinski et al book to be able to use them in conjuction with other datasets
* prep01 prepares the WIOD data (benchmarks) and growth data from Central Statistical Office
We cannot share the data used to produce the results in prep01_02_fdata_productivity, we can only share the results

All results are printed to results folder

The ONLY file which you need to run is the regressions dofile, all other functions are embedded.


The functions needed to run these dofiles
* spatial: spmap, shp2dta
* outputs: tabout,
